**optimal_clusters** -- we work with two well known methods of finding optimal clusters for kmeans clustering: (1) Elbow method - iterates through a number of clusters and then we choose the number where there's a sharp dip in the error. (2) Silhouette method - it is a measure of how similar a data point is within a cluster compared to other clusters. We choose the cluster that maximizes the silhouette score.
